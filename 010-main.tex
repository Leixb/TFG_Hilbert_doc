\begin{abstract}
    A high performance program to find limit cycles in quadratic ordinary systems of
    equations (ODEs) using the computational power of GPUs (Graphical Processing Units)
    was developed. The program is able to find limit cycles on a quadratic system
    in seconds, allowing for a quick visualization of the cycles or to perform a massive
    parameter search to find systems with interesting limit cycle configurations.
