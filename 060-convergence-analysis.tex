\section{Convergence analysis}%
\label{sec:convergence}

Once the sequential code is implemented we must analyze the results obtained to verify the correctness of the program. Therefore a convergence analysis was performed in which we compared the results obtained with our implementation to the theoretical results of a well known ODE.

We used the test system \cref{eq:circle} for which all trajectories are known to have a circular shape with center $(0,0)$ and a period of $T=2\pi$. For each method we found the numerical trajectory 
${\bf r}(t)$ which depends on the specific method used and the timestep.
%computed the error after one loop with different time steps ($\Delta t$). 
The error is calculated as the absolute value of the displacement after one period $T$,
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon = |{\bf r}(T)-{\bf r}(0)|    
\label{Eq:epsilon:T}
\end{equation}
{\bf correct???}

In \cref{fig:error_cycle} we show how the error depends on the timestep $\Delta t$ and on the specific integration scheme. 
This allows to verify the consistency in the order of the integration scheme. For order $p$ of accuracy, the error scales as
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon = {\cal O}((\Delta t)^p)
\end{equation}
As expected, the higher-order methods have higher order of accuracy.
%of all the methods in relation to  correlate to the numerical order of the method.
Additionally, for the higher order methods there is a point in which the numerical error of the method becomes irrelevant since it is less than the {\em machine epsilon}.
The specific value of the machine epsilon depends on the type of variable, CPU architecture and compiler. 
In our case using the precision of \texttt{double} we find that for the Runge-Kutta of order 4 the smallest useful timestep is $\Delta t \approx \dfrac{2\pi}{10^4}$.
A further decrease in the timestep actually worsens the accuracy as this implies a summation of a larger number of values, thus increasing the importance of the rounding error.

The error~(\ref{Eq:epsilon:T}) was calculated by taking into account the exact value of the period $T$. In a more general situation, the period might not be known. Thus we perform a different study in which the error is estimated as the difference in the maximal $x^{max}$ position between two consequent periods, $x^{max}_i$ and $x^{max}_{i+1}$
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon = |x^{max}_{i+1} - x^{max}_{i}|
\label{Eq:epsilon:max}
\end{equation}
{\bf check if you  agree ???}
We computed the error using values of $\Delta t$ non commensurate with the period of the circle and interpolated the period using a second degree polynomial. The results are shown in \cref{fig:error_pi} and are quite different to \cref{fig:error_cycle} since Euler and Midpoint methods appear to have order 2 and RK3, RK4, RKF45 order 3. This is probably due to the polynomial interpolation used and other interpolation methods should be considered to obtain better results. 

\begin{align}\label{eq:circle}
    \frac{dx}{dt} &= -y \nonumber \\
    \frac{dy}{dt} &= x
\end{align}
{\bf what is this???}
