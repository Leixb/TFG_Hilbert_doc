\section{Initial CUDA implementation}

\Cref{fig:time_cuda} shows a comparison of the execution time of the initial
implementation of the CUDA version against the sequential version when
calculating the diameter of the cycles. We can observe that the execution time
in CUDA for 1 to $10^4$ trajectories is roughly the same but past $10^4$ the
time starts to increase.
