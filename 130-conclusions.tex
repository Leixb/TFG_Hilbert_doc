\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:conclusions}

With this project we were able to develop and implement a fast method to assist in the detection of limit cycles by leveraging the computational power of modern GPUs. Although it is written in \emph{C}, it integrated with other programing languages such as \emph{Python} or \emph{Julia} allowing to visualize and further process the data
obtained.
