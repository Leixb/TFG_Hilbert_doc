The appearance of modern computers permits one to use a numerical simulation of complicated nonlinear dynamical systems and to obtain new information on a structure of their trajectories. However the possibilities of naive approach, based on the construction of trajectories by numerical integration of the considered differential equations, turns out to be very limited. In the paper the effective analytical-numerical methods for investigation of limit cycles in two-dimensional polynomial quadratic system are discussed. Estimations of domains of parameters, corresponding to existence of different configurations of large limit cycles, are obtained and visualization of four large limit cycles in quadratic system is presented.},

	doi = {10.1142/S0218127413300024},
	abstract = {From a computational point of view, in nonlinear dynamical systems, attractors can be regarded as self-excited and hidden attractors. Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by a standard computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, starting from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium, reaches a state of oscillation, therefore one can easily identify it. In contrast, for a hidden attractor, a basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria. While classical attractors are self-excited, attractors can therefore be obtained numerically by the standard computational procedure. For localization of hidden attractors it is necessary to develop special procedures, since there are no similar transient processes leading to such attractors.
            At first, the problem of investigating hidden oscillations arose in the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem (1900). The first nontrivial results were obtained in Bautin's works, which were devoted to constructing nested limit cycles in quadratic systems, that showed the necessity of studying hidden oscillations for solving this problem. Later, the problem of analyzing hidden oscillations arose from engineering problems in automatic control. In the 50–60s of the last century, the investigations of widely known Markus–Yamabe's, Aizerman's, and Kalman's conjectures on absolute stability have led to the finding of hidden oscillations in automatic control systems with a unique stable stationary point. In 1961, Gubar revealed a gap in Kapranov's work on phase locked-loops ({PLL}) and showed the possibility of the existence of hidden oscillations in {PLL}. At the end of the last century, the difficulties in analyzing hidden oscillations arose in simulations of drilling systems and aircraft's control systems (anti-windup) which caused crashes.
            Further investigations on hidden oscillations were greatly encouraged by the present authors' discovery, in 2010 (for the first time), of chaotic hidden attractor in Chua's circuit.
            This survey is dedicated to efficient analytical–numerical methods for the study of hidden oscillations. Here, an attempt is made to reflect the current trends in the synthesis of analytical and numerical methods.},

	abstract = {We present {ForwardDiff}, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation ({AD}) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed {AD} tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and {MATLAB}, {ForwardDiff} takes advantage of just-in-time ({JIT}) compilation to transparently recompile {AD}-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, {ForwardDiff} provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, {ForwardDiff}'s gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how {ForwardDiff} is used effectively within {JuMP}, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on {GitHub} depend on {ForwardDiff}, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the {AD}2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},

We formulate a functional equation for the parameterization of the invariant cycle and its isochrons, and we show that it can be solved by means of a Newton method. Using the right transformations, we can solve the equation of the Newton step efficiently. The algorithms are efficient in the sense that if we discretize the functions using N points, a Newton step requires O(N) storage and O({NlogN}) operations in Fourier discretization or O(N) operations in other discretizations. We prove convergence of the algorithms and present a validation theorem in an a posteriori format. That is, we show that if there is an approximate solution of the invariance equation that satisfies some some mild nondegeneracy conditions, then there is a true solution nearby. Thus, our main theorem can be used to validate numerically computed solutions. The theorem also shows that the isochrons are analytic and depend analytically on the base point. Moreover, it establishes smooth dependence of the solutions on parameters and provides efficient algorithms to compute perturbative expansions with respect to external parameters. We include a discussion on the numerical implementation of the algorithms as well as numerical results for representative examples.},

For the continuous version, we show that both problems are uncomputable in the real complexity sense; i.e., their complexity is arbitrarily high. Subsequently, we introduce a notion of an "approximate cycle" and prove an "approximate" Poincar{\textbackslash}'e-Bendixson theorem guaranteeing that some orbits come very close to forming a cycle in the absence of approximate fixpoints; surprisingly, it holds for all dimensions. The corresponding computational problem defined in terms of arithmetic circuits is {PSPACE}-complete.},

	abstract = {{GPUs} and other accelerators are popular devices for accelerating compute-intensive, parallelizable applications. However, programming these devices is a difficult task. Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for {NVIDIA} {GPUs} to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for {GPU} programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official {NVIDIA} {CUDA} toolkit.},

The second half of the famous Hilbert’s 16th problem, proposed in 1900, can be stated as follows (see [70]): For a given integer n, what is the maximum number of limit cycles of system (1.1) for all possible Pn and Qn ? And how about the possible relative positions of the limit cycles ?},
