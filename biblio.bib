The appearance of modern computers permits one to use a numerical simulation of complicated nonlinear dynamical systems and to obtain new information on a structure of their trajectories. However the possibilities of naive approach, based on the construction of trajectories by numerical integration of the considered differential equations, turns out to be very limited. In the paper the effective analytical-numerical methods for investigation of limit cycles in two-dimensional polynomial quadratic system are discussed. Estimations of domains of parameters, corresponding to existence of different configurations of large limit cycles, are obtained and visualization of four large limit cycles in quadratic system is presented.},

	issn = {0218-1274, 1793-6551},
	doi = {10.1142/S0218127413300024},
	abstract = {From a computational point of view, in nonlinear dynamical systems, attractors can be regarded as self-excited and hidden attractors. Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by a standard computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, starting from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium, reaches a state of oscillation, therefore one can easily identify it. In contrast, for a hidden attractor, a basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria. While classical attractors are self-excited, attractors can therefore be obtained numerically by the standard computational procedure. For localization of hidden attractors it is necessary to develop special procedures, since there are no similar transient processes leading to such attractors.
            At first, the problem of investigating hidden oscillations arose in the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem (1900). The first nontrivial results were obtained in Bautin's works, which were devoted to constructing nested limit cycles in quadratic systems, that showed the necessity of studying hidden oscillations for solving this problem. Later, the problem of analyzing hidden oscillations arose from engineering problems in automatic control. In the 50–60s of the last century, the investigations of widely known Markus–Yamabe's, Aizerman's, and Kalman's conjectures on absolute stability have led to the finding of hidden oscillations in automatic control systems with a unique stable stationary point. In 1961, Gubar revealed a gap in Kapranov's work on phase locked-loops ({PLL}) and showed the possibility of the existence of hidden oscillations in {PLL}. At the end of the last century, the difficulties in analyzing hidden oscillations arose in simulations of drilling systems and aircraft's control systems (anti-windup) which caused crashes.
            Further investigations on hidden oscillations were greatly encouraged by the present authors' discovery, in 2010 (for the first time), of chaotic hidden attractor in Chua's circuit.
            This survey is dedicated to efficient analytical–numerical methods for the study of hidden oscillations. Here, an attempt is made to reflect the current trends in the synthesis of analytical and numerical methods.},

	abstract = {We present {ForwardDiff}, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation ({AD}) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed {AD} tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and {MATLAB}, {ForwardDiff} takes advantage of just-in-time ({JIT}) compilation to transparently recompile {AD}-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, {ForwardDiff} provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, {ForwardDiff}'s gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how {ForwardDiff} is used effectively within {JuMP}, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on {GitHub} depend on {ForwardDiff}, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the {AD}2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},

	abstract = {We present efficient algorithms to compute limit cycles and their isochrons (i.e., the sets of points with the same asymptotic phase) for planar vector fields. We formulate a functional equation for the parameterization of the invariant cycle and its isochrons, and we show that it can be solved by means of a Newton method. Using the right transformations, we can solve the equation of the Newton step efficiently. The algorithms are efficient in the sense that if we discretize the functions using N points, a Newton step requires O(N) storage and O({NlogN}) operations in Fourier discretization or O(N) operations in other discretizations. We prove convergence of the algorithms and present a validation theorem in an a posteriori format. That is, we show that if there is an approximate solution of the invariance equation that satisfies some some mild nondegeneracy conditions, then there is a true solution nearby. Thus, our main theorem can be used to validate numerically computed solutions. The theorem also shows that the isochrons are analytic and depend analytically on the base point. Moreover, it establishes smooth dependence of the solutions on parameters and provides efficient algorithms to compute perturbative expansions with respect to external parameters. We include a discussion on the numerical implementation of the algorithms as well as numerical results for representative examples.},

Describing functions are used to model the first harmonic gains of the nonlinearities. Existence of a limit cycle is sought by driving the least damped eigenvalue to the imaginary axis. The evolution of the limit cycle is studied next as a function of a critical system-parameter. It is shown that by defining a suitable error function it is possible to use both the eigenvalue as well as the eigenvector sensitivities to formulate a generalized Newton Raphson method to solve simultaneously for the updates of state variable amplitudes in a minimum norm sense. A case study involving a fifth order control system with three nonlinearities is included to illustrate the application of the method.},

For the continuous version, we show that both problems are uncomputable in the real complexity sense; i.e., their complexity is arbitrarily high. Subsequently, we introduce a notion of an "approximate cycle" and prove an "approximate" Poincar{\textbackslash}'e-Bendixson theorem guaranteeing that some orbits come very close to forming a cycle in the absence of approximate fixpoints; surprisingly, it holds for all dimensions. The corresponding computational problem defined in terms of arithmetic circuits is {PSPACE}-complete.},

The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any {ODE} solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of {ODEs} within larger models.},
