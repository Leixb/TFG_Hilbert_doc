The appearance of modern computers permits one to use a numerical simulation of complicated nonlinear dynamical systems and to obtain new information on a structure of their trajectories. However the possibilities of naive approach, based on the construction of trajectories by numerical integration of the considered differential equations, turns out to be very limited. In the paper the effective analytical-numerical methods for investigation of limit cycles in two-dimensional polynomial quadratic system are discussed. Estimations of domains of parameters, corresponding to existence of different configurations of large limit cycles, are obtained and visualization of four large limit cycles in quadratic system is presented.},

	doi = {10.1142/S0218127413300024},
	abstract = {From a computational point of view, in nonlinear dynamical systems, attractors can be regarded as self-excited and hidden attractors. Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by a standard computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, starting from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium, reaches a state of oscillation, therefore one can easily identify it. In contrast, for a hidden attractor, a basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhoods of equilibria. While classical attractors are self-excited, attractors can therefore be obtained numerically by the standard computational procedure. For localization of hidden attractors it is necessary to develop special procedures, since there are no similar transient processes leading to such attractors.
            At first, the problem of investigating hidden oscillations arose in the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem (1900). The first nontrivial results were obtained in Bautin's works, which were devoted to constructing nested limit cycles in quadratic systems, that showed the necessity of studying hidden oscillations for solving this problem. Later, the problem of analyzing hidden oscillations arose from engineering problems in automatic control. In the 50–60s of the last century, the investigations of widely known Markus–Yamabe's, Aizerman's, and Kalman's conjectures on absolute stability have led to the finding of hidden oscillations in automatic control systems with a unique stable stationary point. In 1961, Gubar revealed a gap in Kapranov's work on phase locked-loops ({PLL}) and showed the possibility of the existence of hidden oscillations in {PLL}. At the end of the last century, the difficulties in analyzing hidden oscillations arose in simulations of drilling systems and aircraft's control systems (anti-windup) which caused crashes.
            Further investigations on hidden oscillations were greatly encouraged by the present authors' discovery, in 2010 (for the first time), of chaotic hidden attractor in Chua's circuit.
            This survey is dedicated to efficient analytical–numerical methods for the study of hidden oscillations. Here, an attempt is made to reflect the current trends in the synthesis of analytical and numerical methods.},

	abstract = {We present {ForwardDiff}, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic differentiation ({AD}) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages like C++. Unlike recently developed {AD} tools in other popular high-level languages such as Python and {MATLAB}, {ForwardDiff} takes advantage of just-in-time ({JIT}) compilation to transparently recompile {AD}-unaware user code, enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and Jacobian calculations, {ForwardDiff} provides a variant of vector-forward mode that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that for nontrivially large dimensions, {ForwardDiff}'s gradient computations can be faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd package. We also illustrate how {ForwardDiff} is used effectively within {JuMP}, a modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41 unique repositories on {GitHub} depend on {ForwardDiff}, with users from diverse fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and statistics. This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation at the {AD}2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.},

We formulate a functional equation for the parameterization of the invariant cycle and its isochrons, and we show that it can be solved by means of a Newton method. Using the right transformations, we can solve the equation of the Newton step efficiently. The algorithms are efficient in the sense that if we discretize the functions using N points, a Newton step requires O(N) storage and O({NlogN}) operations in Fourier discretization or O(N) operations in other discretizations. We prove convergence of the algorithms and present a validation theorem in an a posteriori format. That is, we show that if there is an approximate solution of the invariance equation that satisfies some some mild nondegeneracy conditions, then there is a true solution nearby. Thus, our main theorem can be used to validate numerically computed solutions. The theorem also shows that the isochrons are analytic and depend analytically on the base point. Moreover, it establishes smooth dependence of the solutions on parameters and provides efficient algorithms to compute perturbative expansions with respect to external parameters. We include a discussion on the numerical implementation of the algorithms as well as numerical results for representative examples.},

For the continuous version, we show that both problems are uncomputable in the real complexity sense; i.e., their complexity is arbitrarily high. Subsequently, we introduce a notion of an "approximate cycle" and prove an "approximate" Poincar{\textbackslash}'e-Bendixson theorem guaranteeing that some orbits come very close to forming a cycle in the absence of approximate fixpoints; surprisingly, it holds for all dimensions. The corresponding computational problem defined in terms of arithmetic circuits is {PSPACE}-complete.},

	abstract = {{GPUs} and other accelerators are popular devices for accelerating compute-intensive, parallelizable applications. However, programming these devices is a difficult task. Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for {NVIDIA} {GPUs} to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for {GPU} programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official {NVIDIA} {CUDA} toolkit.},

Recently, four limit cycles were also found in near-integrable quadratic polynomial systems. To help more people to understand limit cycles theory, the visualization of such four numerically simulated limit cycles in quadratic systems has attracted researchers' attention. However, for near integral systems, such visualization becomes much more difficult due to limitation on choosing parameter values. In this paper, we start from the simulation of the well-known quadratic systems constructed around the end of 1979, then reconsider the simulation of a recently published quadratic system which exhibits four big size limit cycles, and finally provide a concrete near-integral quadratic polynomial system to show four normal size limit cycles.},

A perturbation technique for computing normal forms is presented. This technique, associated with the method of multiple scales, can be used to systematically find a unique form for a given set of differential equations. The technique is discussed in detail through the analysis of Hopf bifurcation. It is shown that for Hopf bifurcation, the method only requires solving two dimensional matrix systems for any higher order normal forms of a generaln-dimensional system. With the aid of the symbolic language Maple, this approach is straightforward, and is computationally efficient and fast. Furthermore, a simple verification scheme is given for verifying the normal forms and associated non-linear transformations obtained using any methodology. Examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the perturbation technique and the computation efficiency of the Maple program.},

	abstract = {The behavior of the error in the numerical solution of stiff problems by Runge-Kutta methods is investigated for simple model equations. Error functions are proposed that demonstrate the dependence of the error on the problem stiffness and the coefficients of the method. It is shown that the minimization of the error functions allows one to improve the accuracy of solving nonlinear stiff problems by explicit and implicit Runge–Kutta methods.},

	abstract = {The Fehlberg (4, 5) formulas appear to be the most effective Runge–Kutta formulas of moderate order for the solution of non-stiff ordinary differential equations. A simple; cheap scheme is developed for codes based on these formulas which detects stiffness with considerable reliability. If a user accidentally or unknowingly tries to integrate a stiff problem, a code with this scheme can warn him that it will be extremely inefficient and that he should switch to a code aimed specifically at such problems.},
